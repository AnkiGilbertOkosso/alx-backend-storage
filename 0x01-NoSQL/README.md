**Project: ALX Backend Storage - NoSQL**

## Introduction
Welcome to the ALX Backend Storage project focusing on NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB. In this project, we dive into the realm of non-relational databases, exploring the principles, usage, and practical applications of MongoDB. Through a series of tasks, we aim to develop a solid understanding of NoSQL concepts, MongoDB, and its integration with Python using PyMongo.

## Curriculum Overview
This project is part of the short specialization in NoSQL databases within the backend track of ALX's curriculum. It covers essential topics such as:

- Understanding NoSQL databases and their differences from SQL databases.
- Exploring MongoDB as a document-oriented NoSQL database.
- Hands-on experience with MongoDB commands and Python integration using PyMongo.
- Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in MongoDB.
- Gaining familiarity with querying and modifying data in MongoDB collections.


## Project Structure
The project is divided into tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of MongoDB and its usage. These tasks include:

1. Listing all databases.
2. Creating a new database.
3. Inserting documents into collections.
4. Listing all documents in a collection.
5. Querying documents based on specific criteria.
6. Updating documents in a collection.
7. Deleting documents from a collection.
8. Implementing Python functions to interact with MongoDB collections.
9. Performing advanced operations like updating topics and retrieving schools by topic.
10. Analyzing Nginx logs stored in MongoDB and generating statistics.


## Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on opportunity to delve into NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB, and gain practical experience in working with non-relational data storage. By completing the tasks and adhering to the requirements, I enhanced my skills in database management, Python programming, and data analysis, contributing to your growth as a backend developer.
